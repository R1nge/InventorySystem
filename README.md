Spent 6h35m

[itch.io](https://r1nge.itch.io/inventory-system)

Things that could've done if were asked for or I had more context:  
abstract save system with an interface  
save data migration  
sync inventory view with the model when save has been loaded  

The reason behind having a separate collider/object for taking from an inventory is simple, objects can have too small/big colliders, so it may become increasingly difficult to make a collider that works well in the game and in the inventory
